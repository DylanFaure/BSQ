Epitech Project.

- Use "make re" command to create "bsq"
- Use "./bsq nameofmap" to launch the program with a map (replace nameofmap by a map in "map" folder)

You can also create your own map.   ==> "." representing an empty place
                                    ==> "o" representing an obstacle
